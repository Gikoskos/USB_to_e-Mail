# USB 2 Mail
## Overview

Use this application if you want to automatically send a pre-written email to a user-specified address,
just by inserting a USB device in the hub.

If you have a USB storage device for example, and have its IDs (on Linux you can get the IDs of all your devices by typing
lsusb on a terminal) you can use this application to send an email every time you insert the USB device in the computer.

## Prerequisites

Need to have Perl installed and a couple of Perl packages:
[Email::Send::SMTP::Gmail dependencies](http://deps.cpantesters.org/?module=Email%3A%3ASend%3A%3ASMTP%3A%3AGmail;perl=latest)

To run this program safely on your machine ensure that the Perl script is on the same folder as the executable.

## TODO

Provide basic interface for accepting the emails and passwords as input from the keyboard, instead of having to edit the Perl script.

Add portability code for Windows machines.
